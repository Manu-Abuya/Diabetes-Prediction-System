# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to build a system that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not using Machine Learning techniques. The system is developed in Python, utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for prediction.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Project Structure
- `diabetes-prediction.ipynb`: The main Python script containing the implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and data analysis.
- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, technologies used, and other relevant information.

## Results
The Support Vector Machine model developed in the project achieved an **Accuracy-Score** of 77.27272727272727%.

This metric indicates that the model performs well in predicting whether a person has diabetes or not based on the provided dataset. The high accuracy value suggests that the model is reliable and effective for this classification task.
